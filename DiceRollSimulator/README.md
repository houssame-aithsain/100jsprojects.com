Welcome to the Dice Roll Simulator project. The final version of the project features a dice at the center of the screen and a "Roll dice" button. The button triggers an animation and generates a random number, which is displayed in the center of the dice when clicked, t. Additionally, the number is added to a history list. To achieve this, we used modern CSS to style the dice and added a JavaScript event listener to the button. The listener generates a random number, saves it to an array, and updates the history list.
